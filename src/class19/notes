"this" keyword:
    "this" is a keyword like "class","void". it is used in many places.
     For ex. if we have the same instance and a local variable we can use
     "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable. We can use "this()"
     to call a constructor inside another constructor.
Why we should learn about this keyword?
    1) it allows us to have same name local and instance variables.
    2) if we have same code in 2 constructors we can reuse that code from one
    constructor inside another constructor by writing "this()".
Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use fields/methods
     of 1 class inside another class.
     There are 4 types of inheritance
     1) Single inheritance:
         In single inheritance we have only one parent and one child class.
         Employee->Person.
     2) Multilevel inheritance:
         In multilevel inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a
         grandfather->father->son->grandson
     3) Hierarchical inheritance:
         one parent class and multiple direct child classes.
     4) Multiple inheritance:
        one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes
Why we should learn inheritance?
    It also allows us to reduce the duplicate code.
What is the syntax?
    We can use this feature by writing "extends" keyword when declaring a class.
