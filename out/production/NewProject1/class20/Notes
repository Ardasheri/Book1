What is inheritance?
    It's a mechanism thru which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class
Why we should learn inheritance:
    It helps use avoid code duplication
    it helps save space
    it helps improve the execution speed
What is the syntax?
We use the extends keyword and the same name of the class from which we want to inherit the
fields/methods while declaring the class
Types of inheritance?
    There are 4 types of inheritance but  java only supports 3 of them with classes
    1)Single
    2)Multilevel
    3)Hierarchical
    4)Multiple(it is not supported by classes in java).
Single inheritance:
    When we have one parent and one child class in inheritance, it is called inheritance.(Rarely used)
Multiple inheritance:
    one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes
Hierarchical inheritance:
    one parent class and multiple direct child classes.
Multiple inheritance:
    One child & multiple parent classes. It is not supported by classes in java. It creates the diamond problem.
Super keyword:
    wE USE THE SUPER KEYWORD TO EXPLICITLY CALL THE VARIABLE FROM HE PAREnTN CLASS. When we have the same
    instance variable in child class and parent class
    We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class

MethodOverloading:
    Method overloading allows us to create multiple methods in a class with the same name.
Why we should create multiple methods with same name?
    It gives the end user flexibility
    The end user can call the same methods with different parameters to get same of different results.
How do we overload a method?
    1)By passing a different number of parameters.
    2)By changing the data type
    3)By changing the sequence of parameters
